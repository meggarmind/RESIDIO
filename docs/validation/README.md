# QA-Director Validation System

This directory contains automated validation reports generated by the QA-Director Agent.

## Overview

The QA-Director Agent orchestrates comprehensive code validation across four domains:
1. **Security** - Vulnerability scanning, RLS checks, OWASP compliance
2. **Code Quality** - Architecture review, code patterns, tech debt
3. **Documentation** - JSDoc coverage, docs completeness
4. **Performance** - N+1 queries, optimization opportunities

## Trigger Methods

### Automatic Triggers
- **Prompt Completion**: Moving a file from `prompts/pending/` to `prompts/processed/`
- **Phase Completion**: When all prompts in a phase are completed

### Manual Trigger
```
/qa-director-validate [scope]
```

**Scope Options:**
- `prompt <filename>` - Validate a specific completed prompt
- `phase <number>` - Validate all files for a phase
- `module <name>` - Validate a specific module
- `files <path1,path2>` - Validate specific files
- `all` - Full codebase validation
- *(no argument)* - Auto-detect from git diff

## Report Format

Reports are named: `validation-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

### Severity Levels
| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate action required | RLS violations, exposed secrets, SQL injection |
| **HIGH** | Fix before next release | Missing auth checks, N+1 queries |
| **MEDIUM** | Address in current phase | Code duplication, missing JSDoc |
| **LOW** | Consider for backlog | Style issues, minor optimizations |

## Integration

### Notion Sync
Reports can optionally update Notion prompt status with validation notes. If Notion is unreachable, reports are still generated locally.

### Plugins Used
- `security-scanning` - SAST, dependency scanning
- `security-compliance` - Compliance checks
- `code-review-ai` - Architecture review
- `codebase-cleanup` - Tech debt detection
- `documentation-generation` - Doc coverage
- `performance-testing-review` - Performance analysis

## Configuration

The QA-Director is configured via:
- `.claude/agents/qa-director.md` - Agent definition
- `.claude/commands/qa-director-validate.md` - Slash command
- `.claude/hooks/task-complete.sh` - Auto-trigger hook

## Viewing Reports

Reports are markdown files that can be viewed in any editor or rendered in GitHub/GitLab. Each report includes:
- Executive summary
- Findings by severity
- Action items (prioritized)
- Validator summary with timing
