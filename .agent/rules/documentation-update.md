When new features or enhancements are approved, a high-level to-do list abstracted from the applicable implementation plan should be saved/appended in TODO.md, n the right section or phase. This is updated as tasks are completed. Once a phase and/or section is completed, request to commit and push to remote should be presented to the User. Commit should be automatically done when a Bug is confirmed fixed
